## Demo

## Getting Started

This portfolio app used nextjs because it's a static website. It's suitable with nextjs ( Server-side Rendering ) more than create-react-app.

This portfolio is used to learn to build and host decentralised React App on IPFS by using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host and using [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) to provide decentralised naming.
