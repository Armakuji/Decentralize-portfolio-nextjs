## Getting Started

This modern portfolio application is built with **Next.js 14** and **React 18**, optimized for performance and compatibility with **Node.js 20+**. It features server-side rendering, static site generation, and is designed for decentralized hosting.

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a decentralized React application on IPFS using [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) for hosting files as IPFS hashes and [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) for decentralized domain naming.

### Features
- ⚡ Next.js 14 with React 18
- 🎨 Styled Components v6 with SSR support
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🚀 Optimized for static export and IPFS hosting
- 🔧 TypeScript 5.3+ support
- 🌐 Decentralized hosting ready

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 18.17.0 or higher (recommended: Node.js 20+)
- **npm**: 9.0.0 or higher
